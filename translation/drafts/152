"""I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited
    event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are
    definitely worth noting down and comparing.
    Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.
    You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. 
    Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,
    the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.
    
    
    example:

    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]
    compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]
    """

"""
Mujhe lagta hai hum sabko woh ehsaas yaad hoga jab kisi besabri se intezaar karne wale event ka result finally pata chalta hai. Us samay jo aapke feelings aur vichar hote hain, unhe note down karna aur compare karna zaroori hota hai.
    Aapka task hai yeh determine karna ki kya ek vyakti ne kisi matches ke results ko sahi tara se guess kiya hai ya nahi.
    Aapko do arrays diye jayenge scores aur guesses ke, jinka length equal hoga, jahan har index ek match ko dikhata hai. 
    Wapas ek array return karo jiska length same ho, jo denote karta hai ki har guess kitna off tha. Agar unhone sahi guess kiya hai,
    toh value 0 hogi, aur agar nahi, toh value guess aur score ke beech ka absolute difference hoga.
    
    
    Udaharan:

    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]
    compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]
