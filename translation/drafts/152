"""I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited
    event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are
    definitely worth noting down and comparing.
    Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.
    You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. 
    Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,
    the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.
    
    
    example:

    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]
    compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]
    """

    Mujhe lagta hai hum sabko woh ehsaas yaad hoga jab kisi besabri se intezaar karne wale ghatna ka parinaam ant me pata chalta hai. Us samay jo aapke bhavna aur vichar hote hain, unhe likna aur compare karna zaroori hota hai.
    Aapka kaam hai yeh tay karna ki kya ek vyakti ne kisi matche ke results ko sahi tara se guess kiya hai ya nahi.
    Aapko do arrays diye jayenge scores aur guesses ke, jinka length baraabar hoga, jahan har index ek match ko dikhata hai. 
    Wapas ek array return karo jiska length baraabar ho, jo denote karta hai ki har guess kitna door tha. Agar unhone sahi guess kiya hai,
    toh value 0 hogi, aur agar nahi, toh value guess aur score ke beech ka absolute difference hoga.
    
    
    Udaharan:

    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]
    compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]
