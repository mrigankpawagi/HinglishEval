    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.

    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined
    as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the 
    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of 
    the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous
    term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

    Note: 
        1. Collatz(1) is [1].
        2. returned list sorted in increasing order.

    For example:
    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.

Diye gaye positive integer n ke liye, ek sorted list return karo jo collatz sequence mein odd numbers ko contain karti ho.

    Collatz conjecture ek mathematics ka conjecture hai jo ek sequence ke baare mein baat karta hai
    jise is prakar se define kiya gaya hai: kisi bhi positive integer n se shuru karo. Phir har term ko 
    previous term se is prakar se prapt kiya jata hai: agar previous term even hai, toh next term 
    previous term ka aadha hota hai. Agar previous term odd hai, toh next term 3 guna previous
    term plus 1 hota hai. Conjecture yeh hai ki chahe n ki value kuch bhi ho, sequence hamesha 1 tak pahunchegi.

    Note: 
        1. Collatz(1) is [1].
        2. returned list badhat kram mein sorted hoti hai.

    Jaise ki:
    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # 5 ke liye collatz sequence [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1] hai, toh odd numbers sirf 1, aur 5 hai.
