"""In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers,
    and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements
    between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.
    There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.
    If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make
    all the elements of lst1 to be even, return "YES".
    Otherwise, return "NO".
    For example:
    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => "YES"
    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => "NO"
    It is assumed that the input lists will be non-empty.

"""
Is problem mein, aapko ek function implement karna hai jo do list of numbers leta hai,
    aur yeh determine karta hai ki kya inke beech elements ka exchange karke
    lst1 ko sirf even numbers ki list banaya ja sakta hai.
    lst1 aur lst2 ke beech exchanged elements ki sankhya par koi limit nahi hai.
    Agar lst1 aur lst2 ke beech elements exchange karke
    lst1 ke saare elements ko even banaya ja sakta hai, to "YES" return karo.
    Varna, "NO" return karo.
    Jaise ki:
    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => "YES"
    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => "NO"
    Maan liya jata hai ki input lists khali nahi hogi.
