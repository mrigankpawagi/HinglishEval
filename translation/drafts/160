"""
    Given two lists operator, and operand. The first list has basic algebra operations, and 
    the second list is a list of integers. Use the two given lists to build the algebric 
    expression and return the evaluation of this expression.

    The basic algebra operations:
    Addition ( + ) 
    Subtraction ( - ) 
    Multiplication ( * ) 
    Floor division ( // ) 
    Exponentiation ( ** ) 

    Example:
    operator['+', '*', '-']
    array = [2, 3, 4, 5]
    result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5
    => result = 9

    Note:
        The length of operator list is equal to the length of operand list minus one.
        Operand is a list of of non-negative integers.
        Operator list has at least one operator, and operand list has at least two operands.

Do lists diye gaye hain, operator aur operand. Pehla list basic algebra operations ka hai, aur 
    dusra list integers ka hai. Diye gaye do lists ka use karke algebraic 
    expression banaye aur is expression ka evaluation return kare.

    Basic algebra operations:
    Addition ( + ) 
    Subtraction ( - ) 
    Multiplication ( * ) 
    Floor division ( // ) 
    Exponentiation ( ** ) 

    Udaharan:
    operator['+', '*', '-']
    array = [2, 3, 4, 5]
    result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5
    => result = 9

    Dhyan de:
        Operator list ki length operand list ki length se ek kam hoti hai.
        Operand ek non-negative integers ki list hoti hai.
        Operator list me kam se kam ek operator hota hai, aur operand list me kam se kam do operands hote hain.
