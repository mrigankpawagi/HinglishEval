    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.

Socho ek road ko jo ek perfectly straight aur infinitely long line hai.
    n cars left se right ki taraf ja rahi hain; saath hi, ek alag set of n cars
    right se left ki taraf ja rahi hain. Dono set of cars shuruat mein ek dusre se bahut door hoti hain.
    Saari cars same speed mein move karti hain. Do cars tab takraati hain jab
    ek car jo left se right ja rahi hoti hai, right se left ja rahi car se takraati hai.
    Lekin, cars infinitely sturdy aur strong hoti hain; isliye, unka movement
    unke trajectory mein continue hota hai jaise ki unka collision hua hi nahi.

    Ye function aise collisions ki sankhya output karta hai.
