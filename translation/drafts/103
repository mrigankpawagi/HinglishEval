"""You are given two positive integers n and m, and your task is to compute the
    average of the integers from n through m (including n and m). 
    Round the answer to the nearest integer and convert that to binary.
    If n is greater than m, return -1.
    Example:
    rounded_avg(1, 5) => "0b11"
    rounded_avg(7, 5) => -1
    rounded_avg(10, 20) => "0b1111"
    rounded_avg(20, 33) => "0b11010"
    """

"""
Aapko do positive integers n aur m diye gaye hain, aur aapka task hai n se lekar m tak ke integers ka
    average compute karna (n aur m ko bhi include karte hue). 
    Answer ko nearest integer tak round karo aur usko binary mein convert karo.
    Agar n m se bada hai, to -1 return karo.
    Udaharan:
    rounded_avg(1, 5) => "0b11"
    rounded_avg(7, 5) => -1
    rounded_avg(10, 20) => "0b1111"
    rounded_avg(20, 33) => "0b11010"
