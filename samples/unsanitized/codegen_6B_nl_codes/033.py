So now we are able to sort the lists! However, there are some things we can optimize before calling the above function:

get_sorted_list_three_indices: this function uses the third element of the list as the key to get the right index
get_sorted_list_three_indices: it uses a dictionary for lookup. This is really not needed. The list we sort is three elements long, and there is only one element that could possibly go wrong. So we can just return the sorted list directly.
In both cases a generator comprehension and the slicing operator would make things easier for Python as slicing is a O(1) operation, instead of the iterable we need to perform one more operation.
In case of get_sorted_list_third(l), we can also create more efficient and compact version. We know for sure that every element in the list with index X will have an index in sorted_list_three_indices which is the same as index Y (where Y is X + 2). We can directly add our elements for sorting, then return the sorted list.
