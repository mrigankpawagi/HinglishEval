The values stored in dictionary are always a list of numbers, as they are the values of dictionary keys. Therefore, you can pass a list (of dictionaries) of numbers to the sum_to_n function, and the same for sums.
Sum_toNum = sum_to_n

You can use np.sum as a summary for a sum_to_n function.
>>> sum_to_num(3.4)
array([[ 0.,  0.,  0.,  3.42],
       [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  3.4],
       [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  3.44]])

To summarize it, sum_to_n(d) returns a dictionary with elements of type np.sum:
>>> sum_to_n(3.4)
{'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}

The above summary is pretty close to your desired result, but you might still want to compare with a better result (this is pretty difficult, since each hashkey (key) in a dictionary can have keys which are not numbers, but they still serve the same role as what is in a double-precision floating-point type).
