Now the only other problem I noticed is that you have to give a dictionary inside the function, you can have an optional parameter to remove the dictionary, so if you want to pass in an empty, you're doing it right, but for example, if you want a dictionary, you have to provide a dictionary instead of the empty you got in the example above.
So, I modified your code slightly, it's just calling the function with the extra parameter. 
import sys as os
sys.path.append(os.getcwdu())

from string import *
remove_vowels = lambda text: remove_vowels(text, {})

and ran it (this time I modified a bit the input as my input contains the word, hello and you are inside the word, this is why I add the 'hello' as input:
hello word
hello is inside
the word, you are

here is the output:
word
word

and your question is about the last word, so yes, this is what your output is supposed to be.
I hope this will be helpful to you.
