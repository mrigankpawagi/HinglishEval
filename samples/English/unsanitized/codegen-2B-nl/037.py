A:

Your code does not work because of the n&1 operation on the length of the list l, if n is even then this will evaluate to 0 and the result of n//2 will be 0. Just remove n&1 from the end of the function and it will work as expected.
The code will work as an algorithm recursively by doing the following:

If the list is empty: return (empty list)
If the list is all 0s: return the empty list
If there is at least one nonzero value, the list should be sorted, i.e. the value for position x in the list is less than the value of x - 1.

I would however recomment that you use the built in sorted() function to avoid the need for list operations. The following should work:
