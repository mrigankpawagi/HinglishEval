What is happening here is that the list is a dictionary of two values, 0 and 123 and when we remove the key, we are removing one value from the dictionary. But the same happens when we attempt to remove the value itself.
Is there a way we can get this to work?

A:

Maybe we can pass the object to list comprehension instead of a list. This way we can take values from a dictionary and add them to the original list.
for k1, k2, value in l.values():
    l2 = k2  # k1 is now added as a key to l
    l2._values = []
    for k2, v2 in value.values():
        l2._values.append(k2)

A:

If your question is a type question, the key is really the l.values(), as list or dictionary is just a list of elements of an object or array. So here's my solution:
