Sure, here is the completed Python function:

```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    """
    Evaluate karo ki diya gaya number n kya exactly 4 positive even numbers ka sum ho sakta hai
    Udaharan
    is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True
    """
    return n >= 8 and n % 2 == 0
```

This function works by checking if the given number `n` is greater than or equal to 8 and if it is even. This is because the smallest possible sum of four positive even numbers (2, 2, 2, 2) is 8. Therefore, any number less than 8 cannot be the sum of four positive even numbers. Additionally, the sum of any four even numbers will always be even, so `n` must also be even.
