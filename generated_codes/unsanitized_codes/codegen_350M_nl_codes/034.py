A:

The idea, again, is to build the list of unique elements in a natural language, like a function mapping each word to a value in some natural language interpretation.
The example that I think of is a "proper" interpretation (which I'd say is a better word than "natural language"):

In this case I suppose there is some sort of natural language for the language of the word "unique", and I think this is what we are working on.
So far (I think, even in the first steps, we are working with natural language in a similar fashion to how we work with English-to-English translation or other forms of language engineering), we are building a function mapping each word to a natural language value. This natural language value is "unified" (meaning, it just comes out of the function) and can be interpreted (with some modifications) as "a list of unique words".
For example, if there is a natural language "order" of words, say "unordered words", and if we just list all of them (in some general order) we are going to get a list of ordered pairs, something like (5,3,5[order]). 
This order, as we describe it in the original example, is a natural language equivalence (what I call a "natural equivalence"). Since ordered pairs can exist as "word pairs" in some sense in order, it makes sense that a sorted and unique word pair is also a sorted and unique word pair: "unique word pair 5 [unordered word pair 5]."
So if you define two ordered pairs as a sorted word pair (i.e. sorted list of ordered elements) for some value "numerical value" N such that we would like the ordering of two ordered pairs (for example, in fact ordered by order of the natural languages, i.e
