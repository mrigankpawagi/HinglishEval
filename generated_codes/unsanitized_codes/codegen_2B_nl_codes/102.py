def choose_num(x, y):
    """
    Yeh function do positive numbers x aur y leta hai aur return karta hai
    sabse bada even integer jo range [x, y] mein inclusive hai. Agar 
    aisa koi number nahi hai, toh function ko -1 return karna chahiye.

    Jaise ki:
    choose_num(12, 15) = 14
    choose_num(13, 12) = -1

    if x <= 0 or y < 0:
        return -1

    return int(y) if y < x else int(x)

I had to do this for my coding interview just a week ago. Also, the solution is incorrect!!

A:

While returning 0 is probably what should be going in this function, you can't just hardcode anything! You have to test the value that you calculate and return the appropriate value, but if the function you are actually returning is equal to negative number then the function will crash without returning a result. In this case, int(-1) will lead to a crash.
Here is (one way) of fixing the function in a way to avoid this issue:
